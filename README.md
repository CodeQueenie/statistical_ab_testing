# A/B Testing for Conversion Rate Optimization

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates statistical A/B testing for conversion rate optimization. It includes:
- Simulated data for two groups (A and B).
- Statistical tests (Z-test, Chi-Square test) to evaluate group differences.
- Visualizations of conversion rates and statistical results.

## How to Set Up the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ab_testing_project
2. Create and activate a Python environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n ab_testing python=3.9 -y
   conda activate ab_testing
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open `notebooks/ab_testing.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

5. Select the `Python (ab_testing)` kernel and follow the instructions in the notebook.
