# A/B Testing for Conversion Rate Optimization

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates statistical A/B testing to optimize conversion rates using Python. It includes:
- Simulating data for two groups: control (Group A) and variant (Group B).
- Visualizing conversion rates and distributions to explore group differences.
- Conducting statistical tests:
  - **Z-Test**: To evaluate differences in proportions (conversion rates).
  - **Chi-Square Test**: To assess the independence between group membership and conversion outcomes.
- Enhancements such as power analysis and bootstrap confidence intervals.

**Objective**: To determine whether the variant (Group B) significantly improves conversion rates compared to the control (Group A).

## Features
- **Data Simulation**: Generate reproducible datasets with user-defined sample sizes and conversion rates.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform hypothesis testing using industry-standard methods.
- **Data Visualization**: Create plots to understand group performance.
- **Results Saving**: Store outputs in CSV files and save visualizations for reference.
- **Modular Codebase**: Separate Python scripts for data simulation, visualization, and statistical testing.

## How to Set Up the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeQueenie/statistical_ab_testing.git
   cd ab_testing_project
2. Create and activate a Python environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n ab_testing python=3.9 -y
   conda activate ab_testing
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   conda install --file requirements.txt
4. Open `notebooks/ab_testing.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
5. Select the `Python (ab_testing)` kernel and run all cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Results

### Key Findings
- **Z-Test**:
  - Null Hypothesis (H₀): Conversion rates for Group A and Group B are equal.
  - Result: A z-score of `-0.8717` and a p-value of `0.3834` indicate that the difference in conversion rates is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.
  - **Conclusion**: There is no evidence to suggest that Group B's conversion rate is significantly different from Group A's conversion rate.

- **Chi-Square Test**:
  - Null Hypothesis (H₀): Group membership and conversion outcomes are independent.
  - Result: A chi-square statistic of `0.6384` and a p-value of `0.4243` indicate no significant relationship between group membership and conversion outcomes.
  - **Conclusion**: Group membership and conversion outcomes appear to be independent.

### Power Analysis
- To achieve 80% power at a 95% confidence level, each group must have at least `3,532` participants.

### Bootstrap Confidence Intervals
- **Group A Confidence Interval**: `0.082` to `0.118`
- **Group B Confidence Interval**: `0.092` to `0.133`
- **Conclusion**: The confidence intervals overlap, suggesting no statistically significant difference in conversion rates between the two groups.
